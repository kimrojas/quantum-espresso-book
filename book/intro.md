# Welcome to the Quantum Espresso tutorial

This is a small tutorial for starting DFT calculations with quantum espresso.

The objectives of this tutorial are:

1. Learn how to install Quantum Espresso
2. Do simple energy and structure calculations
3. Post-processing and analysis calculations
4. Research workflows
5. Using Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)
